Welcome to the Guitar Tab Maker project! ðŸŽ¶ I created this tool as a visual guide to assist me in learning the guitar. As a beginner, I found it challenging to memorize the notes on the fretboard and understand how different scales and chords fit together. This project was born out of the need for a clear, interactive way to visualize the guitar neck, see note placements, and toggle between different scales and chords.

About the Project

This tool allows users to:

	â€¢	Toggle notes on the fretboard to see their positions.
	â€¢	View and switch between different scales and chords.
	â€¢	Customize the display to focus on specific notes or fret numbers.

A Work in Progress

Although I initially started this project with great enthusiasm, life happened, and I had to put my guitar learning on hold. As a result, this project remains incomplete, but itâ€™s still a cool side project that Iâ€™m proud of. I believe it has the potential to grow into something even more useful for guitar learners.

Contributions Welcome!

Iâ€™m happy to accept contributions from anyone interested in taking this project further. Whether youâ€™re a fellow guitarist, a developer, or someone who just loves cool side projects, feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or share ideas on how this tool can be improved.
